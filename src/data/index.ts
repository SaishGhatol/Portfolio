    "HERO_CONTENT": "I'm a passionate full-stack developer crafting high-performance web applications with seamless front-end and robust back-end systems. Specializing in React, Next.js, and Node.js, I build responsive, user-friendly interfaces and scalable RESTful APIs, managing data efficiently with SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB). Recently, I developed a real-time chat app using WebSockets, merging dynamic interactivity with secure, real-time synchronization. With a problem-solving mindset and clean code practices, I turn complex ideas into scalable, user-centric solutions. Letâ€™s connect and bring your next digital vision to life! ðŸš€",
